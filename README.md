# 3D Designs
A collection of different projects I've done over the years. 
All of them created using the SolidWorks and printed on a comercial 3D printer.

| Portable display | Converted an laptop screen into a second display. |
| PSP mod | Replaced the UMD drive of PSP with 2 18650 batteries. | 

## SolidWorks 
All of the pieces were designed using SolidWorks 2016, which I learnt to use in a technical drawing class in university.
