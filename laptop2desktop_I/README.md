# Laptop 2 Desktop I

## Description
I converted my old Chuwi Aerobook into a desktop, by extracting the motherboard, soldering on a button and placing it into a custom 3D printed case. I also added a small fan, and some heatsinks to keep it all cool. I did this conversion because the laptop's plastic frame had started to disintegrate, and the battery had died. Unfortunately, I've lost the SLDPRT and STL files :< I now use it as a server, running Ubutunu Linux Server.
