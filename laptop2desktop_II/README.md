# Laptop 2 Desktop II

## Description
Similarly to the Laptop 2 Desktop I, I converted my Dell Inspiron 7577 into a desktop. It took 2 attempts to do so, and I ended up using wood for most of the construction. I also added quite a few fans and heatsinks, but it remained annoyingly loud. And again, I lost the SLDPRT and STL files.
